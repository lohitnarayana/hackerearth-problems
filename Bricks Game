Patlu and Motu works in a building construction, they have to put some number of bricks N from one place to another, and started doing their work. They decided , they end up with a fun challenge who will put the last brick.

They to follow a simple rule, In the i'th round, Patlu puts i bricks whereas Motu puts ix2 bricks.

There are only N bricks, you need to help find the challenge result to find who put the last brick.

Input:

First line contains an integer N.

Output:

Output "Patlu" (without the quotes) if Patlu puts the last bricks ,"Motu"(without the quotes) otherwise.

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10000

SAMPLE INPUT 
13
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
Motu
Explanation
Sample Explanation:

13 bricks are there :

Patlu Motu

1 2

2 4

3 1 ( Only 1 remains)

Hence, Motu puts the last one.


PROGRAM:
#PYTHON3.6
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    p=i
    if(n-p>=0):
        n=n-p
    else:
        print("Patlu")
        break
    m=i*2
    if(n-m>0):
        n=n-m
    else:
        print("Motu")
        break
